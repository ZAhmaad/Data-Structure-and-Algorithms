## Introduction

This course aims to introduce the fundamental concept of data structures and to emphasize the importance of data structures in developing and implementing efficient algorithms. Efficient data structure provides basis for a good algorithm (code). This course focuses on the most common data structures utilized in various computational problems. It will be taught that how these data structures work and their implementation. Students will practice implementing them in a number of programming assignments. This will help them understand the nuts and bolts of various data structures and enable to write efficient programs. In addition, another objective of the course is to develop effective software engineering practice, emphasizing such principles as decomposition, procedural abstraction, and software reuse.




## Course Objectives

- üéØ **Data Structure/Algorithm Analysis**  
  Utilize the basic techniques of data structure/algorithm analysis.

- üõ†Ô∏è **Application of Primitive Data Structures**  
  Apply the primitive data structures to design solutions for computational problems.

- üîç **Algorithmic Problem Solving**  
  Analyze problems and write program solutions using algorithmic techniques with a variety of data structures and techniques..
